    <h1>Original response</h1>
    <p>If you're seeing this response, then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is your first visit and the service worker was not installed yet.</li>
      <li>This is a subsequent visit and:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>service workers are not supported by your browser.</li>
        <li>you have Javascript disabled so the service worker could not be installed.</li>
        <li>the service worker was blocked from installation or otherwise failed.</li>
        <li>the service worker has since been forcibly unregistered.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><i>NB: Whether the origin server was actually hit to get this response is another question entirely (due to caching etc).</i></p>
